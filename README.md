# Introduction
This notebook is a result of a master's project in supervised learning.  Given the choice of topic, I initally veered directly towards climate change oriented work.  However, I stumbed upon the stop and frisk questionnaire dataset while perusing the NYC Open Data site.  After comparing some of the previous analysis from 2016, I found the line of inquiry much more compelling and fascinating from a social impact point of view.  

With an initial perusal of the data via pivot tables, I was just shocked that there are a disturbing number of disproportionate stops of black children and black individuals at large.  

Racially biased policing is a phrase that's almost redundant for the anti-racist individuals, so I'm not uncovering anything new here.  

But are these findings statistically significant?  Is this dataset truly representative of stop and frisk? Is there anything here in the data that might improve the lives of our NYC neighbors?  I may be asking these questions (and assuming their answers) as an average NYC resident, but I hope to answer them rigorously as a data scientist and as a machine learning engineer.  

As such, I decided to focus on a 2024 exploration of the NYPD generated dataset to find latent truths hidden in the data and attempt to train a predictive model which helps hold the NYPD accountable, but more importantly to provide tooling to aid those who are unjustly targeted.
